Today, I signed into my AWS/Amazon Web Services online account;      
where I started experimenting with learning how to use, Cloud9.  

-----

Cloud9, offers a web server/programming IDE/plus, terminal environment...;    
where it's possible to experiment with different programming languages, including:-    

- bash shell scripting  
- php  
- nodejs  
- python  
- etc. 

Because, the enviroment is Linux based you can use editors:-  

- nano  (my favourite/which I as a long term Windows user...tend to find by far the easiest to learn/use)       
- emacs    
- vim  
- sublime  
- etc.  

-----

It's very interesting...  

- there are an awful lot of docs to go and read through...;        
  meaning, at this 'beginner' stage of practice;     
  it's doubtful that I'm using the platform in accordance with what are 'best' practices.    

- experimenting with learning 'hands on'...is, certainly, a much more worthwhile effort;        
  than, is just merely sitting back and reading books/or, watching videos about learning it      
  (most of which advice; one, immediately, tends to forget...?!);    
  because what you 'do'...; then, you are much less likely to ever forget having done.    
  
  Just like 'riding a bike'/or else, 'learning to swim'...;     
  watching others doesn't really work...;  
  when it comes to, actually, learning to 'do it' yourself.
