    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
     This is my first Amazon Amplify web site. 
    </p>
   
    <p>
     The Amazon Amplify service, makes it really very quick and easy to get set up...; just connect any GitHub code repository to Amazon; do a few 'set up' clicks here and there: choose where is your nearest Amazon web server/give the site a name/-etc.; wait for everything to fully deploy...and, then, within no more than just merely a few minutes, you find you're all done; the Amazon web site URL address you are given is, now, 'live'...and, thus, your web page/(s) are all, immediately, viewable over the internet.
     </p>
   
     <br><br> 
   
     <p class="clsNote">
      -(<b>NOTE</b>: Unfortunately, this site is <b>not</b> being hosted by Amazon for FREE...; and, therefore, I will need to keep a very careful eye out to check for any potential charges which might be steadily accumlating...; by going to visit seeing <a href="http://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon AWS</a> site, regularly.)-
