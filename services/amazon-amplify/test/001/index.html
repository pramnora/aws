    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>
     This is my first Amazon Amplify web site. 
    </p>
   
    <p>
     The Amazon Amplify service, makes it really very quick and easy to get set up...; just connect any GitHub code repository to Amazon; do a few 'set up' clicks here and there: choose where is your nearest Amazon web server/give the site a name/-etc.; wait for everything to fully deploy...and, then, within no more than just merely a few minutes, you find you're all done; the Amazon web site URL address you are given is, now, 'live'...and, thus, immediately, viewable over the internet.
     </p>
    
   
    <p>
     This site is NOT being hosted by Amazon for FREE...; and, therefore, I will need to keep an eye out to check for any potential charges which might be steadily accumlating...?
