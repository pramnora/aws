Surfing the net, as usual, I came across the following, Amazon Amplify link:

https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?code=9e4129050d9036217099&installation_id=29168200&setup_action=install&region=us-west-2#/  

...which makes it possible...in just a few clicks to connect a GitHub repo...to Amazon Web Services...Amazon Amplify web site hosting platform.

TEST 1/CONNECT TO A GITHUB HOSTED PAGE/YES, WORKED

Did a test using Amazon Amplify...created an 'index.html' file...then, deployed it, successfully.

The URL address given to me by Amazon is...

- https://main.d2zb3c0jzrj0bf.amplifyapp.com/  

*NOTE*: I clicked on the above/and, it works!

The only question, now, is...how to take the site down...; 
so that Amazon won't charge me any money...???

I found a link which said Delete aws...; so, I clicked it. 
The reply was aws, successfully, deleted.

(But, I might need to get that confirmed.)

-----

TEST 1/CONNECT...THEN, MAKE CHANGES TO THE GITHUB HOSTED PAGE...TO SEE IF THOSE CHANGES ARE REFLECTED, IMMEDIATELY, IN THE AMAZON AMPLIFY LINK? ANSWER: YES/BUT, NOT INSTANTLY...TAKES A FEW MINUTES FOR THE CHANGES TO PROPOGATE

This is the new URL address I was given...

- https://main.d1vxf8kplkvgt0.amplifyapp.com/

...about to go and change my [index.html] page within GitHub...; then, go and check if the new URL reflects back those changes...? 

I tried clicking the web browers [refresh] button, repeately...for, around at least 1 minute...and, not change appeared. 

Then, I walked downstairs to go let the cat out...clean out the dish she had just eaten from.

When, I came back upstairs, and, again, hit the web browser [refresh] button...; this time the changes worked.

Once more, I deleted the 'aws' instance. (Hoping to save any charges occurring.)

Initial testing done. ;-)
