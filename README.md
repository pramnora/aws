# aws/Amazon Web Services

Amazon, has **a lot** of different web services...; all of which I would really *love* to go and learn;        
however, bearing in mind, that they have so *many* services to go and study...;    
-(plus, with many more services being newly created, constantly, all the time)-;     
therefore, I'm sure, that job is going to take a me a very long LONG time still to come.      

On top of this is the fact that using *any* of the **cloud based** platforms which include   
(but, isn't necessarily 'limited' to...as there are plenty more cloud platforms out there):-            

- AWS/Amazon Web Services  
- GCP/Google Compute Cloud  
- Azure cloud/(from Microsoft)  

...can also prove to be extremely *expensive*...if you are not careful to budget really well;    
or else, forgot to immediately pull down any *test* services which you've gone and created.
