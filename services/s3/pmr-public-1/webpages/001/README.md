I created this bucket:  

> pmr-public-1  

...just a few day's back; with the intention to serve web pages up from there.    
 
Single web page retrieval worked fine.  

However, when I tried breaking up the pages into being a series of 'linked' files';    

css.01    

/-etc. I found that none of the links were, actually, working...?    
Meaning, the index.html page...did NOT retrieve the .css stylesheet;  
nor would it retrieve any linked to web page, neither.  

That is that say whenever I tried typing in the Amazon assigned web site URL adress...;     
the linked part did NOT show...; and, whenever I tried to access these resources on an individual basis...;     
all that got displayed back was a similar worded XML document...?!     

Quite obviously, I must have left off some setting which is used to make all linked web pages/too, CSS public;    
but, right now, I really don't know how to go about correcting this...?   
At some future point I will have to try doing this exercise, again.  

Right now, though, I've left up 2 buckets I went and create days back...   

> pmr-private-1   (stores 1 x .txt file)    
> pmr-public-1    (stores 1 x .html file/1 x .css file) 

...Why? Because, I don't think Amazon is charging me very much to use these services;      
if I had a lot of pages...and, was continually retrieving them...;    
then, the charges, I bet, would be that much more...?!
