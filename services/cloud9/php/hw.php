/*
 I tried running this PHP script with tags

<?php
 echo "Hello, world!";
?>

But, the cloud9 editor kept showing a red (x) around the <?/?> PHP tags part; 
so, I decided to take those tags out.
 
I tried typing into the console: echo "Hello, world!"
...but, it wouldn't let me do that, neither; 
instead, it said press CTRL+C to stop the server running.

Next, I tried going to my own web browser window; and, typing in URL address: 
0.0.0.0:8080
...and, that returned nothing (I figure, because the code is not running on my own home based computer);
so, I tried typing in both of the following URL's...(each of which I saw when running the server):   

- https://44.195.90.41/
- https://44.195.90.41/hw.php  

...and, that didnt work, neither...?  
So, eventually, I gave up.../or, at least, temporarily;   
will return back to try, again...possibly, after reading more.
