Did a test using Amazon Amplify...created an 'index.html' file...then, deployed it, successfully.

The URL address given to me by Amazon is...

- https://main.d2zb3c0jzrj0bf.amplifyapp.com/  

*NOTE*: I clicked on the above/and, it works!

The only question, now, is...how to take the site down...; 
so that Amazon won't charge me any money...???
