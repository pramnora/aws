I came across the following Amazon Amplify link:

https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?code=9e4129050d9036217099&installation_id=29168200&setup_action=install&region=us-west-2#/  

...which makes it possible...in just a few clicks to connect a GitHub repo...to AWS/Amazon Web Services: Amazon Amplify, web site hosting platform.

TEST 1: Created a very simple 'index.html' file...using no more than 1 line of text/(no HTML code)...saying: Just testing...

TEST 2: Did the same as above...; only, later on, I went and updated the 'index.html' page using GitHub editor...to say 2 lines of text...;  
wanted to see just how long it would take for the changes to appear...; answer, it took a few minutes...not 'instant'.

TEST 3: Decided to create a proper HTML web page...; and, test how it would serve that...;  
(actually, I used a 'redirect' page...from the main(aws) folder directory to: services/amazon-amplify/test/001/index.html)

TEST 4: I stayed with the same web page above...; but, this time I selected 'monorepo' before deploying...;  
which allowed me to select exactly which folder to display(so, no need for 'redirect' page, anymore);
much to my own surprise, I was given a much 'shorter' URL address this time.

-(PS: I noticed, too, that with each new deployment...;   
inside of the Amazon 'billings' section...my a/c. is getting charged...;      
got to 'watch' that particular section of their site really very carefully.)-
