Surfing the net, as usual, I came across the following, Amazon Amplify:

https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?code=9e4129050d9036217099&installation_id=29168200&setup_action=install&region=us-west-2#/  

Did a test using Amazon Amplify...created an 'index.html' file...then, deployed it, successfully.

The URL address given to me by Amazon is...

- https://main.d2zb3c0jzrj0bf.amplifyapp.com/  

*NOTE*: I clicked on the above/and, it works!

The only question, now, is...how to take the site down...; 
so that Amazon won't charge me any money...???

I found a link which said Delete aws...; so, I clicked it. 
The reply was aws, successfully, deleted.

(But, I might need to get that confirmed.)
