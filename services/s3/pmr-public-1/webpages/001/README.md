I created this bucket:    
> pmr-public-1  
...just a few day's back;    
with the intention to serve web pages from there.  
  
However, when I tried breaking up the pages into being a series of 'linked' files';    
linked:  
css.01    
/-etc. I found that none of the links were, actually, working...?    
That is that say whenever I tried typing in the Amazon assigne4d web site URL adress...;   
the linked part did NOT show...instead, all that got displayed back was a similar worded XML document.     

Quite obviously, I must have left off some setting which is used to make all linked web pages/too, CSS public;    
but, right now, I really don't know how to go about correcting this...?  
At some future point I will have to try doing this exercise, again.  

Right now, though, I've left up 2 buckets I went and create days back...;    
> pmr-private-1    
> pmr-public-1   
...Why? Because, I don't think Amazon is charging me to use these services.../   
or, even, if they are...then, not by very much.
