I created this bucket: pmr-public-1, some day's back;
with the intention to serve web pages from there;
however, when I tried breaking up the pages into being a series of 'linked' files':
linked css.01/-etc. I found that no of the links were, actually, working...?
That is that say whenever I tried typing in the web site URL adress...;
the linked part did NOT show...instead, all that got displayed was a XML document.

Quite obviously, I must have left off some setting which is used to make all linked web pages/too, CSS public;  
but, right now, I really don't know how to go about correcting this...?
At some futher point I will have to try, again.

Right now, though, I've left up 2 buckets I went and create days back...;
pmr-private-1
pmr-public-1
...because, I don't think Amazon is charging me to use these services.../
or, if they are...then, not by much.
